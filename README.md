# traffic-light-project
this project talks about how to make traffic light this project semulates the traffic light
this pro has its job road organinzition and save the pepole from danger
this project divided to code and semulation
firsr the code write about c++ language the code divided to first definition of ports this used to 
definition the pins in arduino 
and second definition void setup inn which it is writen command in the out put 
and third definition void loop tin which it is written command in the project example :-
specifies which led will work before the other and the time it will take for the led light 
second :- semulation is work in the program proteus and the first step definition the library arduino in proteus becouse know definition the arduino in the proteus put the arduino uno in prog  and put the three led 
one :-red 
two:-yellow
three:-green 
and three resistant measur oum 
the connecting is made pin ten of possitive led green and pin nine of  popssitive led yellow and pin eight of positive led red  and put about every led resistant and connect the every nigative about ground and get the arduino hex in proteus and run the program 
find the led red work for a period of time five second after that led yellow work of a period of time two sec after that led green work of a period of five sec
